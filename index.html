      <h2>Responsive Sidebar Example</h2>
      <p>
        This example use media queries to transform the sidebar to a top
        navigation bar when the screen size is 700px or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also added a media query for screens that are 400px or less,
        which will vertically stack and center the navigation links.

      <h3>Resize the browser window to see the effect.</h3>
      <p>
        Ideally, paragraphs should be well connected to each other. Order
        paragraphs so that each one follows logically from the previous one.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this logic more obvious, you can use transition words (or
        “connectors”), so that the paragraphs flow better and the reader is
        always kept on track.
      </p>
      <h3>Connecting Paragraphs Together</h3>
      <p>
        As the author, you know why one paragraph relates to the next, because
        you’ve put a lot of effort, research, and thought into the planning of
        this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your reader isn’t as well-versed in the subject as you are, however.
        Adding transition words and phrases helps cue your reader into the
        connections between ideas you’ve already made for yourself.
